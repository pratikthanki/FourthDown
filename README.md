# FourthDown

## Background

Most tools to analyse NFL data is limited to Python and R packages or misc data from GitHub repos, that means all the C#/.NET devs (and all other languages) are missing out or needing to create data pipelines to actually make doing any analysis work-able!

The aim of this API is to make it easier to work with the data, without having to do much more (formatting/parsing) around it. whilst also being language agnostic and extensible. This Web API has been written in ASP.NET Core 3.0.

There are a set of API endpoints to query team, schedule and various aspects of game data. You can find more details on the [Swagger](https://pratikthanki.github.io/FourthDown/) page.

## Thanks

Shoutout to the following people and their projects for making this API feasible.

From the game data and modelling of EPA, WP and CPOE amongst othe things available in the R package [nflfastR](https://github.com/mrcaseb/nflfastR) ([Ben Baldwin](https://twitter.com/benbbaldwin) and [Sebastian Carl](https://twitter.com/mrcaseb)).

Game schedule data going back to 1999 from [Lee Sharpe](https://twitter.com/LeeSharpeNFL).

You can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pratikthanki) with any feedback or questions. I also write about all things CS on my [blog](http://pratikthanki.github.io/).
