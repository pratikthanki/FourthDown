Most tools to analyse NFL data is limited to Python and R packages or misc data from GitHub repos, that means all the C#/ .NET devs are missing out 
or needing to create data pipelines to make actually doing any analysis work-able!

Credit and inspiration for this goes to the guys of the R package [nflfastR](https://github.com/mrcaseb/nflfastR) 
(cc/ [Ben Baldwin](https://twitter.com/benbbaldwin) and [Sebastian Carl](https://twitter.com/mrcaseb)).
